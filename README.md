# Technical Specification: Python Code Reachability Analyzer

## 1. Overview
A static code analysis tool that identifies unreachable code fragments in a Python codebase by analyzing call graphs and code paths starting from a specified main function.

## 2. Objectives
- Identify Python code fragments that are not reachable from the main entry point
- Generate detailed reports of unused functions, classes, and methods
- Support modern Python codebases with multiple files and packages
- Minimize false positives in dynamic Python code patterns

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Input Requirements
- Path to the Python project root directory
- Path to the main entry point function
- Optional configuration file for exclusions and special cases
- Support for virtual environments and package dependencies

### 3.2 Analysis Capabilities
- Static code parsing and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis
- Call graph generation and traversal
- Import statement resolution
- Detection of:
  * Unused functions and methods
  * Unused classes
  * Dead code blocks
  * Unreachable conditional branches
  * Unused module-level variables
  * Unused import statements

### 3.3 Special Cases Handling
- Decorators and metaprogramming patterns
- Dynamic imports and getattr() usage
- Mock objects and test files
- Abstract base classes and interfaces
- Event handlers and callback functions
- Command-line entry points

## 4. Output Format

### 4.1 Report Structure
- JSON and HTML report formats
- For each unreachable code fragment:
  * File path and line numbers
  * Type of code fragment (function, class, method, etc.)
  * Confidence level of unreachability
  * Suggested action (remove, investigate, or ignore)
  * Context information (e.g., nearest reachable code)

### 4.2 Summary Statistics
- Total lines of unreachable code
- Percentage of codebase affected
- Distribution of unreachable code by type
- Historical tracking of metrics

## 5. Configuration Options
- Exclusion patterns for files and directories
- Custom entry points besides main
- Ignore patterns for specific code patterns
- Confidence threshold for reporting
- Output format and verbosity settings

## 6. Performance Requirements
- Analysis time should scale linearly with codebase size
- Memory usage should not exceed 2x the size of the codebase
- Support for incremental analysis on large codebases

## 7. Limitations
- May not detect all dynamically generated code
- Limited support for eval() and exec() statements
- May produce false positives with complex metaprogramming
- Cannot guarantee detection of runtime-dependent code paths

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- IDE plugin support
- Interactive code removal suggestions
- Support for analyzing multiple entry points
- Historical trending of unused code metrics

## 9. Error Handling
- Clear error messages for parsing failures
- Graceful handling of syntax errors
- Detailed logging of analysis process
- Recovery mechanisms for partial analysis

## 10. Integration Requirements
- Command-line interface
- Python API for programmatic usage
- Exit codes for build pipeline integration
- Support for common code quality tools

## 11. Security Considerations
- Safe handling of source code
- No modification of original files
- Proper handling of sensitive information in reports
- Secure configuration file handling
